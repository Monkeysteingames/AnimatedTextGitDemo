Part I:

1.What git command creates a branch?

git branch 

2.What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?

fast-forward: making commits chronologically from latest branch to master
recursive: making commits at random times off of different branches in no chronological pattern

3.What git command changes to another branch?

git checkout

4.What git command deletes a branch?

git branch -d

5.How do merge conflicts happen?

Making edits in the same file off of two different branches and then trying to merge those two branches together to eachother or the master. 


------------------------------------
Part II:

Practice with fast forward and recursive merges! Make a branch and add and commit onto it and merge it back into master.



Try to create your own merge conflict by modifying the same file on two separate commits on two separate branches.
